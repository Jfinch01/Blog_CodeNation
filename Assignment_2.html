        <h3>Describing the layout of each page 1. 1 </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Home Page </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> I'm going to be making this blog in a relatively standard blog format. I'm going to have a home page, with 
                        all my different page links on there. With links that 1.) open in a new tab and 2.) takes you to the page in 
                        the same window. For the background I've asked a friend to draw me a neural network that's basically a bunch
                        of blue lines with some purple shading (But we shall see what she comes back with...) </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Page 1, Assignment Page </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> On this page I'm going to have the background of the image from the first page and a white, paper type block 
                        going down the middle where all my content will be, structured layout with each of the tasks laid out with space
                        between them in order to keep everything easily readable. Having titles and content on different colours and 
                        sizes. </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Page 2, Assignment Page </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> On this page the layout will be the same as page 1 in order to keep it consistent and all the styles look the 
                        same. It makes it easier to read and given the fact that the content is essentially the same style then there 
                        would be no need to change the style page by page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3> Describing copyright constraints on websites. 1. 5 </h3>

        <p> A major constraint of the copyright law is that you can't just use any type of image or information you want. You would have to go 
            through the actual author and creator of the content before you could use it unless you look for none copyrighted things in a 
            refined google search. </p>

        <p> If you choose to ignore all the copyright laws and use the information anyway then you could have legal action taken against you 
            which can result in either a fine or jail time depending on what you're using the copyrighted item for. You're more likely to have 
            legal action taken against you if you're looking to use their images or information for marketting and branding purposes without
            first gaining permission to do so from the author.  </p>

        <p> With this in mind though it can also work to your advantage in that if you have something on your website that you don't want 
            other people using, you can put a copyright claim in and if no one else already has then you're allowed to put the Â© symbol on
            your product. </p>

        <h3> Describing access issues for users, how people with disabilities may be affected and how it would be possible
            to overcome them. 1. 6 </h3>

        <p> Since there are a huge range of disabilities, I'm only going to focus on a few of them. Firstly one that can affect how people 
            use your website could be someone who is colour blind, a good way to counteract this could be by giving the users a colour blind 
            option with different types of colour blindless predefined so that they are able to view the entire website in their chosen colour 
            scheme with little to no hassle. This would have to be put into the settings since it only caters to certain demographics which 
            would evidently require some sort of technical knowledge, knowing where to look to change these settings. </p>

        <p> Another one to focus on would be catering to the blind. In order to counteract this I would set up a text to speech format so that 
            everything on the screen that was either selected or hovered over was then spoken so that they would understand what's going on and 
            they're not clicking on random things and basically doing themselves over. Although I would have to look up some tutorials on how 
            to do so or ask a family member of mine that has developed software for this in that they use the camera to look at something and the 
            software would then tell the user what it's looking at (which I thought was so cool!) </p>

        <p> Finally I'm going to look at auditory disabilities in that you would be able to alter the sound for people who are both hard of hearing 
            and those who are sensitive to sound. I would counter this in the settings again by adding a sound scrollbar in order to increase or 
            decrease the sound. </p>

        <h3> Appropriate file types for websites. 1. 7 </h3>
        
        <div class="container">
        <img src="file:///Users/codenation/Documents/Blog/HTMLvsCSS.jpg" alt="HTML vs HTML and CSS" class="center">
        <ol class="nextToImage">
            <li> .AVI Audio/Video InterLeaved - This is a Video file type, supported by Windows. It's not very good for streaming videos sincde you have to download the entire 
                file before you can view it. If it's left uncompressed then it can be a very large file type but by compressing it you might lose some 
                video quality, although for the most part they do have very high video quality going up to 1080p. </li>
            <li> .CCS Cascading StyleSheet - This basically covers how the website is going to look, using different style types and can be created in any sort of text editor 
                such as NopePad or anything along those lines. </li>
            <li> .EXE Executable file - When you click on this file type, either in browser or if it gets sent to you, it runs a file automatically and doesn't always require 
                require admin rights in order to run depending on the code of the .EXE file. </li>
            <li> .HTML HyperText Markup Language - This is what most website pages load in, it's basically the skeleton for any site, setting out all of the data before you apply 
                CSS to style it. </li>
