            <h3> Information technology in modern day businesses. 1. 1 </h3>

            <p> Technology has been helping businesses, both large and small, ever since it first started. 
                It allows automation of different day to day tasks, allows communication between people with 
                relative ease and basically just makes everything easier. From computers to smartphones and 
                everything inbetween, over time technology has evolved to fit the needs of it's users. It 
                allows communication with people world wide that wasn't possible 100 years ago with the 
                creation of the world wide web and this benefits people everywhere because now information is 
                so easily acsessable. It's allowed all sorts of businesses to create different solutions to 
                problems they didn't even know they could solve before technology, speeding up advancements
                in medical technology, communication and data storage and analysis. </p>
                <p> Overall Technology has made a massive impact on businesses of all types and sizes. </p>

            <h3> Resources needed to complete digital projects, make them successful. 1. 2 & How have my chosen technologies helped me achieve my chosen outcome. 1. 6 </h3>

            <h4> Different tools used? what kind of skills are needed? </h4>

            <p> Whenever I would start a new project, I would first need to plan. A very good tool used by a 
                lot of developers in project planning would be an app or website called 'Trello'. This basically
                makes it easier to divide all the different tasks among developers in a team, setting each task
                out in a user friendly and easily accessable way. Allowing teams to work better because it gives
                you a UI to work with so everyone can see what they have to do, and where everyone else on their
                teams are up to with their work. </p>

            <p> Version control is always a good idea when developing a project on a team. It helps with understanding
                who changed what in a piece of code. If you make a change to your code and it ultimately breaks, you
                would then have a much easier time in going back and undoing the problem you created. It would also be
                easier to see if someone else has altered your code to either try and help or to add malicious code.
                It also makes it easier to see new ideas put into your code and how they work well with he rest of them.
                Finally it's also a good thing for if you have to do a different project that has the same baseline code
                as a previous one you've done so you can just take that earlier version and save yourself a lot of time. </p>

            <p> Next I would make sure that I have an IDE I'm comfortable using so either Visual Studio code
                (What I used to create this blog) and/or SublimeText (Because I've used it before coming to 
                CodeNation) in order for my code to be translated into readable/useful mobile or web applications. </p>

            <p> As well as technological ideas and tools I can be using, I would also use more primative contraptions
                like my notepad (because I like to have all my notes in an easy, readable format that I'm able to move
                around with me so I don't have to bring my computer with me everywhere I go.) A clock is another useful
                tool in order to make sure that I'm keeping up with deadlines. Time waits for no man. </p>

            <p> Finally, probably the most usful tool any IT professional could possibly have would be a 
                trusted web browser, humans can't retain every piece of information they come into contact with
                (unless of course they have an idtetic memory, which sadly I do not possess) so having all the
                information I would ever possibly need right at my finger tips is detrimental to completing a task
                to the best of my ability. </p>

        <div> 
            <h3> Risks for digital projects. 1. 4 </h3>

            <p> Probably the biggest risk for digital projects (in my opinion) would be data loss. This can happen
                due to a number of reasons ranging from damage to the phsycial storage, file corruption (which can 
                happen for a multitude of reasons such as maybe the processor fails, misreads some data and outputs
                it to the console but in a more fractured format so the user is unable to read it. A virus can also
                have the same effect making files unreadable in a ransomeware attack or just a straight up dataloss
                attack in order to stop, slow down or destroy company production.) Sometimes people can misplace hard
                drives with their data on so they have to start again from scratch (which is why backups of your data
                is a good idea in order to mitigate the damage caused by losing the data) and sometimes even powercuts 
                before someone saves their work is another common way people lose their data which is another reason
                for backups. </p>
            
            <p> A very high risk for any IT professional, especially a developer are hacks. Given the fact there
                are hundreds of thousands of hacks out there, with new ones being developed all the time, it's a constant
                battle between white hats/developers creating and securing websites and data, and black hats, looking for
                new ways to break their code, access information they don't have clearence for and basically just watch
                the world burn for either money or fun. You get both types really... </p>

            <h3> How would I go about selecting different IT systems and software. 1. 5 </h3>

            <p> The first step I would take would be to define what type of task I am going to be carrying out and what my 
                budget was. This would make deciding what type of tools I would need to be using a lot easier, since I would 
                be looking know exactly what it was I would be doing. I would first have to communicate with my team different 
                aspects like deciding if it was going to be an app, web page, desktop app etc. </p>

            <p> After that I would decide what type of PC I would be using. I personally would select a Windows 10 OS, on a 
                laptop that has at least 16GB of RAM so I can load up software quickly and have it run smoothly, 1.024TB Hard Disk 
                Drive and a 256GB Solid State Drive so that I have more than enough storage space for all my data as well as have my 
                PC load up quickly. I would make sure that my laptop had a i7 processor so that it could render images easily and 
                be able to run everything smoothly without much lag and so that programs don't take up all the CPU usage when/if I have 
                CPU intensive software running with many tabs open. Finally I would make sure that my graphics card was at least up
                to the standard of GeForce GTX 1070 Ti so there was little to no lag, making my process a lot smoother. </p>
            
            <p> Next I would look into splitting up every task that would need to be carried out (or at least the ones I can 
                think of when I start the task because sometimes other things pop up during development that I either didn't 
                know about or didn't think of at the start of the project) and I would probably be using trello to do this
                since being able to view each task and format them in a way I can split up each catagory of ideas so that I
                don't get lost. I can also see the things I have already finished as I'm doing through it all and this makes
                it easier in my mind and stops me from getting overwhelmed with it all and end up missing things out, or 
                stopping/slowing production. </p>

            <p> Once I know exactly what it is that I need to be doing, I would then start working in my chosen language (Python,
                JavaScript or HTML + CSS) and if I ever came into contact with some sort of issue I would be using a search engine,
                StackOverFlow and GeeksforGeeks for resources, but if I was still stuck then I would ask someone with more coding 
                experience than myself to help me find out what the issue is so if I come to the problem again in the future, I 
                would be able to deal with it a bit easier. </p>

            <h3> Legal guidelines and constraints that can impact a project. 1. 7  </h3>

            <p> EU GDPR guidelines gives individual rights to consumers and what happens to their data. These rights are as follows: </p>

            <ol style="list-style-type:circle ">
                <li> The right to be informed. This essentially means that whatever data is being used, the person who owns the data 
                    is allowed to know what it happening to it and kept up to date with where their information is being used. </li>
                <li> The right of access. This essentially means that people have the right to see/access data that is either public
                    knowledge or what their own data is. They can request access to their personal details that are being held by a 
                    specific company or governing body. As well as (using NASA as an example) having data that is kept about a country's 
                    space program is being open source so anyone can see what's going on. </li>
                <li> The right of recification. This essentially means that a person is able to change their personal data, in scenarios
                    like if they were to move house, they are allowed to update their information so it's not fully set in stone. </li>
                <li> The right to erasure. This essentially means that they're allowed to have their data removed from a database if they
                    believe that their data is being misused in any kind of way. </li>
                <li> The right to restict processing. This means that if your data is given to a company, you can refuse the use of this 
                    information meaning that the data can only be stored and not used for things like targetted marketing. </li>
                <li> The right to data portability. This gives people the right to move their data from one database to another without
                    the company that holds the information being able to object. This would be used for something along the lines of
                    changing what internet service provider or bank you're with. </li>
                <li> The right to object. This essentially gives the user the right to now allow their data to be used in a given scenario,
                     for example if someone doesn't want their picture to be used on social media for marketing, they would be allowed to
                    tell the comanpy this and then they wouldn't be allowed to post anything of your personal information. </li>
                <li> Rights in automated decision making and profiling. From what I've gathered I would assume that this is when you go
                    onto a website and it tells you that they are using cookies of your searches, personal data and many other options.
                    This company has to inform the user of this and the user has the option for their data not to be used by the company. </li>
            </ol>

        <h1> Task 2 </h1>

        <h3> Review the use of IT tools in making my website. 2. 1 & whether they were appropriate 2. 2 </h3>

        <p> The first tool I used was Visual Studio Code which I don't really have any faults with other than the auto fill feature that kept 
            adding pieces of information and code where it wasn't needed and wasn't what I was looking for, which got a little frustrating but 
            it was managable so I've got nothing to complain about really.  </p>

        <p> The second tool we were asked to use was Trello. Personally I don't like it at all, and probably wouldn't be using it for personal 
            projects. I wasn't a huge fan of the UI, the lack of functions once you had created something, I wasn't able to delete any rows (which 
            I don't know if that was to do with me being blind to it and the option was there or it just wasn't possible. Either way I wouldn't use 
            it personally.) I can see why it would be good for a team of developers though, being able to divide up all of the different tasks without 
            needing to have face to face communication so people could just get on with their jobs, the tasks were easily readable so it wouldn't hinder 
            productivity at all. It's also pretty good for defining who needs to complete which task which I thought was a pretty cool feature, it would 
            save multiple people from doing the same thing which could ultimately cause issues later on. </p>

        <p> Final tool would have been different websites like W3Schools and CSS-Tricks which were all very helpful whenever I either got stuck or 
            had a question about what it was I was writing. Their websites weren't exactly the easiest to navigate but after a quick google search it 
            made finding what I needed a whole lot easier. GitHub was also a very usful tool for handing in my work, it's a version control site that allowed 
            me to save my code, adding to it all bit by bit without needing to have a million different files in my folders for each version of my website. It 
            took me some time to figure out terminal syntax but once I wrapped my head around it, it got a whole lot easier for me. </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3> Assessing the strengths of my website, whether or not I was happy with it? 2. 3  & Describe further improvements on my website 2. 4 </h3>

        <p> Overall I am relatively happy with my website. It's nothing like what larger sites are with all their features but I believe it does what it was 
            intended for. All my buttons are working properly, links going to the correct places, images are forming as they're supposed to. I think my only real 
            issue that, I have is that the background image decides to change size depending on how much content I have on each page so that's something I'm going 
            to look into making a static image as a background that doesn't move when I scroll instead of having an image that fits the entire page. </p>

        <p> Another function I could have added would be drop down boxes on each link to another page so that I could then select certain parts of my site that 
            I wanted to view, meaning that I would be able to go straight to a different part of the same page without having to scroll for ages to find what I'm 
            looking for. </p>

        <p> Finally I could have probably come up with a better colour scheme, I just don't know colours well enough to know which colours compliment each other but 
            I'm not unhappy with the choices I've made, I just believe I could have done a better job if I had a little more experience with front end design. </p>
            
        <h3> Testing my website for functionality and overall user accessability 2. 5 </h3>
    
        <p> Personally I believe that my website works in terms of functionality. Everything I had set out to do in my trello board, works as it's supposed to. 
        DO USER TESTING TOMORROW WHEN PEOPLE ARE HERE </p>
    
        <h1> Task 3 </h1>

        <h3> Reviewing benefits and drawbacks of IT tools used in building my website. 3. 1 </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Visual Studio Code </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Benefits - This would include things like having a predefined IDE that I can work with, was a huge help rather than using something as simple as 
                        a WordPad or some other form of text editor. Having a lot of the options I can use by just typing the first letter of any option helped a lot because 
                        it opened up a lot of doors for me since I wouldn't have even thought to be using some of the tools I have done without being first show the options 
                        of what this IDE is capable of doing as well as what the programming language I am using is capable of. </li>

                    <br></br>

                    <li> Drawbacks - The only drawback I can think of would be the auto fill function that Visual Studio implements, in that if I was typing something in a 'p'
                        tag, and typed something simple as 'ad' it would auto correct it to a function that I wasn't using which then hindered productivity because of the 
                        frequency in which it was happening. </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Trello </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Benefits - I can see how using Trello could be very benefitial because it allows teams of developers to all work on the same project without needing to 
                        constantly ask where everyone is up to. It makes dividing up tasks a lot easier since you can assign people certain tasks and it then gives them a notification
                        (if it's set up like that on their device but that's down to personal preference) letting them know which evidently improves productivity. It's also got a friendly 
                        user interface and doesn't require much tech know-how to be used, everything is displayed quite well excluding certain things that someone using Trello would then 
                        most probably pick up with time and use. </li>

                        <br></br>
                    
                        <li> Drawbacks - For individual projects, I don't think that using Trello is such a good idea because I can keep track of all my own tasks and what I need to be getting 
                        on with. It would only be if I was doing a development project with many people that I would post the idea of using Trello in order to keep everyone up to date with
                        what is done, needs doing and is currently being done. Also not being able to delete things after they have been created caused a lot of issues for me and made me 
                        like using it even less. Having a lot of unused things made it look messy and that wasn't good for me. I'd rather is all be neat. </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Slack </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Benefits - Slack was a really good instant messaging application, with real time updates which I quite liked. I didn't have to constantly refresh the page every 
                        time I knew a message was coming through, it also gave me a lot of ease when it came to having questions and queries about the tasks given, it helped a lot with my 
                        productivity. </li>

                    <br></br>

                    <li> Drawbacks - I didn't really have any. </li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
