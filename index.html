        <h3> Why I'm interested in Technology? </h3>

        <p> Since I was about 7, I completely fell in love with video games and that started off my enjoyment for being sat behind my keyboard. 
            I've spent countless hours improving my typing speed and networking with people from all around europe, who were also interested in 
            computers so that was basically my way in. I met people from all types of backgrounds, from farmers and bakers to cyber security 
            specialists and web developers. This basically developped my love for coding and cyber security after watching my friend find some 
            vulnerabilites in a high end website, that basically showed me how no system is truly safe and it's good to have people like him 
            making sure that everyone is safe online. </p>

        <p> Ever since my friend essentially opened my eyes to the world of computing, I've been working to develop my skills in that field. 
            Looking into YouTube tutorials, trying to crack a Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), looking at and testing FreeCodeCamp 
            tutorials for web development, looking into Python programming for things like scripts and ethical hacking/penetration testing, 
            as well as using the rest of my free time to research more trivial, none technological things like mandarin, martial arts, anatomy 
            and physics. I just want to learn as much as I can so I'm able to impliment ideas from different backgrounds into my own home life 
            and be able to develop, test and maintain everything without having to rely on other people after a certain point. </p>

        <p> I believe technology is the best way forward to automation. It gives me options and tools to use in order to make menial tasks that
            can get quite repetative a lot easier. If I've done something once in coding, I shouldn't really have to be doing it again and I like
            that outlook on things because if something is boring and I have to do it all the time, I'm going to look for easier ways to do the task 
            without having constantly repeat it over and over again. </p>
